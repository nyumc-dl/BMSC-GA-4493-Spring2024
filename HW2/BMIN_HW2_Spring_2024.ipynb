This layer reduces the output feature resolution and this implies that the output features loose the certain amount of spatial information. Therefore when we design CNN, we usually increase the channel length to compensate this loss. For example, if we apply the max pooling layer with kernel size of 2 and stride size of 2, we increase the output feature size by a factor of 2. If we apply this max pooling layer, how much the receptive field increases? Explain the advantage of decreasing the output feature resolution with the perspective of reducing the amount of computation."

    "_Some background:_ In network architecture design, we want to have an architecture that has enough capacity to learn. We can achieve this by using large number of feature maps and/or many more connections and activation nodes. However, having a large number of learnable parameters can easily result in overfitting. To mitigate overfitting, we can keep the number of learnable parameters of the network small either using shallow networks or few feature maps. This approach results in underfitting that model can neither model the training data nor generalize to new data. Ideally, we want to select a model at the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting. It is hard to find the exact sweet spot. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to make sure we have enough capacity to learn, without a capacity we will underfit. Here, you will need to check if designed model in 4.3. can learn or not. Since we do not need to check the generalization capacity (overfitting is OK for now since it shows learning is possible), it is a great strategy to use a subset of training samples. Also, using a subset of samples is helpful for debugging!!!"
